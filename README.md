# Library Management System using SQL

## ðŸ“† Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive **Library Management System** using **MySQL**. It includes data modeling, DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations, as well as stored procedures for automating book issuing and return processes.

## ðŸ“‘ Database Name
```sql
CREATE DATABASE library_db;
```

---

## ðŸ“‚ Tables Created

### 1. `branch`
- Contains information about each branch.

### 2. `employees`
- Stores employee details and their branch affiliation.

### 3. `members`
- Holds library member data.

### 4. `books`
- Manages book metadata and availability.

### 5. `issued_status`
- Tracks which books are issued, to whom, and by which employee.

### 6. `return_status`
- Records return information and book condition.

## ðŸ”§ Operations Performed

### CRUD Operations
1. Delete a book by title.
2. Insert a new book record.
3. Update a member's address.

    emp.emp_name, 
    emp.branch_id,
    count(*) as books_processed

limit 3;
```

### 14. Procedure to manage book status during issuance
```sql
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE book_status_management(
    p_issued_id VARCHAR(10), 
    p_issued_member_id VARCHAR(30), 
    p_issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(30), 
    p_issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10)
)
BEGIN 
    DECLARE book_status VARCHAR(10);

    SELECT status INTO book_status FROM books WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

    IF book_status = 'yes' THEN
        INSERT INTO issued_status(issued_id, issued_member_id, issued_date, issued_book_isbn, issued_emp_id)
        VALUES (p_issued_id, p_issued_member_id, CURDATE(), p_issued_book_isbn, p_issued_emp_id);

        UPDATE books SET status = 'no' WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

        SELECT CONCAT('Book record added successfully for the book isbn: ', p_issued_book_isbn) AS message;
